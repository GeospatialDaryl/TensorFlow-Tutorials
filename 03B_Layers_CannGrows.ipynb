    "\n",
    "It is important to use a builder API when constructing Neural Networks in TensorFlow because it makes it easier to implement and modify the source-code. This also lowers the risk of bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the other tutorials used the TensorFlow builder API called PrettyTensor for easy construction of Neural Networks. But there are several other builder APIs available for TensorFlow. PrettyTensor was used in these tutorials, because at the time in mid-2016, PrettyTensor was the most complete and polished builder API available for TensorFlow. But PrettyTensor is only developed by a single person working at Google and although it has some unique and elegant features, it is possible that it may become deprecated in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is about a small builder API that has recently been added to TensorFlow version 1.1. It is simply called *Layers* or the *Layers API* or by its Python name `tf.layers`. This builder API is automatically installed as part of TensorFlow, so you no longer have to install a separate Python package as was needed with PrettyTensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is very similar to Tutorial #03 on PrettyTensor and shows how to implement the same Convolutional Neural Network using the Layers API. It is recommended that you are familiar with Tutorial #02 on Convolutional Neural Networks."

    "The input image is processed in the first convolutional layer using the filter-weights. This results in 16 new images, one for each filter in the convolutional layer. The images are also down-sampled using max-pooling so the image resolution is decreased from 28x28 to 14x14.\n",
    "\n",
    "These 16 smaller images are then processed in the second convolutional layer. We need filter-weights for each of these 16 channels, and we need filter-weights for each output channel of this layer. There are 36 output channels so there are a total of 16 x 36 = 576 filters in the second convolutional layer. The resulting images are also down-sampled using max-pooling to 7x7 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the second convolutional layer is 36 images of 7x7 pixels each. These are then flattened to a single vector of length 7 x 7 x 36 = 1764, which is used as the input to a fully-connected layer with 128 neurons (or elements). This feeds into another fully-connected layer with 10 neurons, one for each of the classes, which is used to determine the class of the image, that is, which number is depicted in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolutional filters are initially chosen at random, so the classification is done randomly. The error between the predicted and true class of the input image is measured as the so-called cross-entropy. The optimizer then automatically propagates this error back through the Convolutional Network using the chain-rule of differentiation and updates the filter-weights so as to improve the classification error. This is done iteratively thousands of times until the classification error is sufficiently low.\n",
    "\n",
    "These particular filter-weights and intermediate images are the results of one optimization run and may look different if you re-run this Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the computation in TensorFlow is actually done on a batch of images instead of a single image, which makes the computation more efficient. This means the flowchart actually has one more data-dimension when implemented in TensorFlow."

    "\n",
    "This tutorial showed how to use the so-called *Layers API* for easily building Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow. The syntax is different and more verbose than that of PrettyTensor. Both builder API's have advantages and disadvantages, but since PrettyTensor is only developed by one person and the Layers API is now an official part of TensorFlow Core, it is possible that PrettyTensor will become deprecated in the future. If this happens, we might hope that some of its unique and elegant features will become integrated into TensorFlow Core as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have been trying to get a clear answer from the TensorFlow developers for almost a year, on which of their APIs will be the main builder API for TensorFlow. They still seem to be undecided and very slow to implement it."

    "* Plot the output of the max-pooling layers instead of the conv-layers.\n",
    "* Replace the 2x2 max-pooling layers with stride=2 in the convolutional layers. Is there a difference in classification accuracy? What if you optimize it again and again? The difference is random, so how would you measure if there really is a difference? What are the pros and cons of using max-pooling vs. stride in the conv-layer?\n",
    "* Change the parameters for the layers, e.g. the kernel, depth, size, etc. What is the difference in time usage and classification accuracy?\n",

    "* What is the simplest network you can design that still performs well?\n",
    "* Retrieve the bias-values for the convolutional layers and print them. See `get_weights_variable()` for inspiration.\n",
